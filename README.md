# LongLostFriends

This is a site for people to build communities of generous and like-minded people; and have a go to place when something is lost or found.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.3.

## Set up

### Required
* Git
* Bower
* Node
* Angular
* Firebase

* Git clone from repo (github.com/ColinJB/lost-and-found)
* Run `npm install` in command line to download node_modules
* Run `bower intall` in command line to download bower_components
* Run `bower init` in command line to initialize bower.
* This application will not work unless you create your own firebase account. I have git ignored the file holding my api key and other info for firebase.

## Development server
